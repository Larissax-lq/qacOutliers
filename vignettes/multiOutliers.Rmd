## kNN

kNN calculates the distances between a data point and its k-nearest neighbors,
snd assigns an outlier score based on that distance. If the outlier score is 
above 0.95, then kNN considers the data point as an outlier.

## LoF

Local Outlier Factor for a point is the average density around the k-nearest 
neighbors of the point divided by the density around the point itself. If the 
LoF score is above 1, it ts more likely to be anomalous, if it is below 1, it 
is less likely to be anomalous.
